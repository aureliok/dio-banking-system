# Dio - Python Developer Bootcamp

## Description
This project aims to simulate a simple banking system using Python, FastAPI and MongoDB. It's done as a necessary project to finish Dio's Bootcamp, and I took the liberty to take the main idea of the app, and develop it on my own for learning purposes, not necessarily following the structure given in advance on the course.

In short, the project has only 2 classes, User and Account, and they have basic methods that do some expected functionalities on a CRUD system. There's also modules containing services, which handles operations that would follow perhaps a business logic and the api routes, which would handle the communication with a interface.

Also, I used a TDD approach to develop the project, so I would define the tests for the functionalities first, and then write the code for the methods to make them pass the tests written beforehand.
